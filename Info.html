<p id="text"> Information about the Model 3's Infotainment System: The Infotainment system has basic options for the car like your AC settings, heating system, how many miles per hour you're driving and the battery percentage

It has "FM/Internet Streaming Audio" and "Bluetooth Hands Free Calling and Media Streaming." But there has been no notice on playing a satelite radio or playing audio from your phone (like music).

But Tesla has confirmed to 'Roadshow' that any missing functionalities at launch would be added in a later update It is rumored the Infotainment system includes Tesla's very own music streaming service named "TTunes".
