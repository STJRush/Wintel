<h1 id="texthead" >More Info:</h1>

<p id="text"> Information about the Model 3's Infotainment System: The Infotainment system has basic options for the car like your AC settings, heating system, how many miles per hour you're driving and the battery percentage

It has "FM/Internet streaming audio" and "Bluetooth hands free calling and media streaming." But there has been no notice on playing a satelite radio or playing audio from your phone (like music or whatever).

But Tesla has confirmed to Roadshow (another news outlet) that any missing functionalities at launch would be added in a later update It is rumored the Infotainment system includes Tesla's very own music streaming service named "TTunes".
